Readme of the Lennard-Jones fluid simulation using Monte Carlo techniques

Main results included in Lennard-Jones_fluid directory:
- t.out: file which contains the times for the different simulations performed in serial and
  parallel
- grs.png: representation of g(r) for N = 100, 150 and 200 particles in a cubic box of side L = 6
  obtained with serial and parallel (2 and 4 procs) codes.
- grs_T.png: representation of g(r) for the same density and different values of temperature. 

The serial version of the simulation is the module LJfluid.f90. To use this module the main.f90
is needed, where the user can modify several variables as the number of particles, the volume or the 
temperature as well as the number of MC cycles and equilibration cycles. 

The parallel version of the code is contained in the parallel_version directory, where there are 
also a LJfluid.f90 module (parallel simulation) and a main.f90 file, where the user can also
modify the number of processors used in the simulation. 

The output files provided by the simulation are initial_geom.xyz, final_geom.xyz (initial and final
geometry of the particles in the cubic box that can be read by vesta or vmd), V.out (potential
energy for a sample of MC steps) and g.out (pair correlation function g(r) of the system).

Several results of serial and parallel versions are contained in analysis directories, included
in Lennard-Jones_Fluid directory for the serial simulation and in 
Lennard-Jones_Fluid/parallel_version for the parallel simulation. These results are the potential
energy of a sample of MC steps and the pair correlation function for different densities. Python
scripts used to make the plots are also contained in these directories (called g.py and 
potential.py). The main results are contained in Lennard-Jones_Fluid. The output files are 
labelled as follows:
- Output files for potential energy: V_N_particles.out (serial) and V_N_particles_procs.out 
  (parallel)
- Output files for g(r): g_N_particles.out (serial) and g_N_particles_procs.out (parallel)
- Representation of potential energy: V_vs_cycleMC_N_particles.png (serial) and 
  V_vs_cycleMC_N_particles_procs.png (parallel)
- Representation of g(r): gr_N_particles.png (serial) and gr_N_particles_procs.png (parallel)
  N is the number of particles and procs the number of processors used in the simulation.

Inside analysis directories there are comparison directories, where there are plots of pair 
correlation functions with different densities and temperatures, which allow to compare the results
obtained with the simulation.
