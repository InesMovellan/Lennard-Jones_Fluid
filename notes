- Programming language: FORTRAN 90
- Monte Carlo algorithm for displacements
- Serial code version
- Then: paralelization and molecular dynamics simulation

- Read information
- Create github repository to upload the code
- Create a main program main.f90
- Create a module to perform the simulation
- Create a makefile to compile and execute the code
Inside the module, we have create the initial_geom(n,L,geom0) subroutine, which allows to create
the initial geometry of the system setting (at least now) a random distribution of the particles.
The geometry is written in an xyz file that could be read with avogadro. On the other hand,
we have done an algorithim with 2 do loops to calculate the square of the inter-particle 
distance among all particles. To do that, we store the distances in a matrix in which the
off diagonal elements are zero: 
r12 r13 r14 r15 ... r1n
0   r23 r24 r25 ... r2n
0   0   r34 r35 ... r3n
0   0    0   :       :
:   :    :   :       :
0   0    0   0  ... rnn

In the same subroutine (energy) we have computed the value od r**12 and r**6 which will be
used to obtain the potential energy, in the same loop as r**2. After calculate r**2 we calculate
(r**2)**6 = r**12 and (r**2)**3 = r**6
